The gallery component helps the user quickly browse media thumbnails (images, videos and audio clips) . Each thumbnail displays a caption describing the media item along with a visual icon to distinguish between video clips, audio clips and images.

When clicking or tapping a media  thumbnail, the user can visualise the media (in overlay modus) in a bigger size and access additional controls for video and audio playback.
